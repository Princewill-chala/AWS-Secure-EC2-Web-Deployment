# AWS-Secure-EC2-Web-Deployment

## Overview
This project demonstrates the secure deployment of a production-ready static website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an EC2 instance running Ubuntu 22.04.
It follows cloud security best practices, including proper IAM usage, network hardening with security groups, key-based authentication, Elastic IP assignment, and basic Linux server hardening.

The goal is to simulate a real-world cloud deployment scenario and document it professionally for DevOps and Cloud Security portfolios.
